# GStreamer_Playground
This is a repo for working with many gstreamer concepts in C++. 
Development is for a Windows console application, although this can easily be converted to a Linux console app. 
The underlying code can be used in various forms - include in libraries, include directly in other applications, etc.
Download and install gstreamer into the c:\gstreamer directory
Create a c:\gstreamer_projects folder and git clone gstreamer_playground into this directory
Open the solutions file in the Windows IDE (I used Visual Studio 2022), and build the executable
